## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Navigate to ComfyUI custom nodes directory
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KyouichiAmagase/ComfyUI-UniversalDetailer.git

# 3. Install dependencies
cd ComfyUI-UniversalDetailer/
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Restart ComfyUI
# Universal Detailer node will be available in the "image/postprocessing" category
```

### Basic Usage
1. Add "Universal Detailer" node to your ComfyUI workflow
2. Connect your image, model, VAE, and conditioning inputs
3. Configure detection parameters (faces, hands, etc.)
4. Run the workflow to get enhanced images with improved details

## Overview

Universal Detailer is an advanced ComfyUI custom node that extends FaceDetailer functionality to support detection and correction of:

- 👤 **Faces**: High-quality face detection and enhancement

### Performance Tuning
```python
# Example configuration for optimal performance
{
    "detection_model": "yolov8n-face",    # Fastest option
    "confidence_threshold": 0.7,          # Balance accuracy/speed
    "mask_padding": 32,                   # Optimal padding
    "inpaint_strength": 0.8,              # Quality vs preservation
    "steps": 20                           # Sampling steps
}
```
